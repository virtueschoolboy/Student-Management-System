# Student-Management-System
Python script that uses SQLite to save and delete student records.

This is my main project for my 300L IT prep. It’s a command-line tool written in Python that actually talks to a database (SQLite). I programmed it so you can add new students, view the list, and delete people using their ID number. The data doesn't disappear when you close the program because it's all saved in a .db file. This was my first time connecting Python logic to actual SQL storage.

## 🛠 How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Open your terminal and run: `python app.py`
4. Select any option (1-4).
5. The system will automatically generate the `university.db` file upon execution.

 A screenshot of how the result will look like has been added to my portfolio.
